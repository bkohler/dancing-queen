# Gem Update Plan

## Steps

1. Create Backup
   - Backup current Gemfile and Gemfile.lock before making any changes
   - This allows us to rollback if needed

2. Update Gemfile
   - Remove version constraints where safe to do so
   - Update deepseek-ruby to latest version
   - Keep only necessary version constraints for stability

3. Update Dependencies
   - Run `bundle update` to update all gems to their latest versions
   - This will update Gemfile.lock with all new versions

4. Testing
   - Run the test suite to verify everything works
   - Start the development server to check for any runtime issues
   - Test key functionality, especially around deepseek integration

5. Rollback Plan (if needed)
   - If issues are encountered, restore from backup
   - Address any specific gem compatibility issues
   - Update gems incrementally instead of all at once

## Next Steps

Once this plan is approved, we should switch to Code mode to implement these changes.
